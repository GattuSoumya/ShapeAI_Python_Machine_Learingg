<br> I got to have hands on experience on:
<li> Python
<li> Machine Learning
<li> Tensorflow
<br>during the 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basic so that anyone with zero experience on programming can Learn.
I enjoyed these 7days, you can as well.To register for the next free 7 days Bootcamp , visit:
